An interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. While this might not be the most appetizing dataset, many interesting facts can be gleaned including; that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. On the dashboard a client has a drop-down menu to chooose a Test Subject ID Number. The box below the drop-down will contain the demographic information of the subject, while the horizontal bar chart to the right will display the top ten bacteria found. Below these will be a bubble chart that displays each sample with the OTU ID being the x values and indicated by color. The sample value will be the y value as well as indicated by marker size. Each chart has an interactive tooltip to display the OTU information when hovered over and will update when a different ID is chosen from the drop-down menu.
